I recently visited the TMDB page for <a class="italic" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/209867">Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</a> to leave the show a review. The first thing to stick out to me was that the show was listed as having one season. 'That's strange' I thought, considering I had just finished watching the 4th episode of season 2. Then I noticed season 1 was listed as having 39 episodes. Season 1 only had 28 episodes. That's when it hit me. You are counting season 2 as part of season 1 in your official episode ordering.

Every time I visit the page my body and soul are filled with an unpleasant sensation that can only be described as not liking what I'm seeing. I have tried to move past it, to ignore it, but it's not working. I can't stop thinking about it.

Current TMDB policy for anime states that official site of a show should be the primary source for episode ordering, and that any show using continuous numbering shall be treated as a single season on TMDB. I urge you to either reconsider this decision or to make an exception for Frieren, <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/37854">as you have for other shows in the past.</a>

## It's not a technical limitation

When looking at the TMDB page for One Piece, you might notice that the most recent episode is noted as 22x1155, but season 22 only has 68 episodes. Curious. It is clear that there are no technical constraints influencing TMDB policy on this matter, since it doesn't negatively impact One Piece. I can see no reason from a technical standpoint that Frieren could not recieve this same treatment.

## The official site splits the show into two groups

While I will concede that the <a href="https://frieren-anime.jp/story/">official site for Frieren</a> does list the episodes of season 2 with continuous numbering instead of starting over at 1, it also does explicitly break the show into two distinct stories. It could easily be argued that this is merely a translation issue, and that these two stories are effectively two seasons of the show.

## We have enough on our plates right now already

As proud residents of Minnesota living through a violent military occupation by federal forces brought here to terrorize us for petty, politically motivated reasons. Do you really expect us to also carry the mental burden of knowing that Frieren is listed as a single season on your site? Not a good look.

At difficult times like this we need to embrace empathy and come together. We need to focus our energy on making the world a little bit better each day. We need to remember that this is all a ploy to keep us fighting amongst ourselves so that we don't ever stop to notice the one's screwing us all are the people at the top. We need to focus our energy on looking out for one another and helping each other when and where we can.

That's a great idea in theory, but it all falls apart if our judgement is clouded. Without changing your classification of Frieren episodes, I can guarantee it will be. Do the right thing.
