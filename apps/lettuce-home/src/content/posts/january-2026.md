I'm trying out doing monthly roundups of the books I've read and movies that I've watched. Who knows if this is something that I keep doing long-term but I will try at least for a few months. I also retroactively wrote up a roundup for december of 2025.

## Books completed

I set myself a goal of reading 24 books this year. One month in and I'm already a quarter of the way there! I started
reading Matt Dinniman's <a class="text-putty-500 italic" href="https://openlibrary.org/search?q=subject_key%3A%22seriesdungeon_crawler_carl%22" target="_blank">Dungeon Crawler Carl</a>
series and got hooked pretty quickly. I expect I'll be caught up with the series before the end of next month. I would
definitely recommend it based on what I've read so far, and I hear it only gets better as you go.

<FilteredEntries type="book" start="2026-01-01" end="2026-01-31" />

## Movies watched

Lots of movies this month, too. Quite a few of them were rewatches, but I also watched a number of other movies that I
would definitely see myself watching again in the future. <a class="text-putty-500 italic" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1198994">Send Help</a> was probably the biggest surprise for me this
month. It surpassed my expectations.
