I started tracking the tv show seasons that I complete this year. I wasn't sure if it was worth the extra work to also grab images for those to include here, but so far this year I've only actually completed 3 seasons. Maybe I was worried about nothing?

## Books completed

<FilteredEntries type="book" years={[2026]} months={['02']} />

## Movies watched

## Shows I've been watching

I'm not keeping up with very many weekly shows right now. The two main ones are the second season of <a class="italic" href="https://www.thetvdb.com/series/sousou-no-frieren">Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</a> and <a class="italic" href="https://www.thetvdb.com/series/sentenced-to-brave-punishment">Sentenced to be a Hero</a>.
At some point I will get caught up on <a class="italic" href="https://thetvdb.com/series/jujutsu-kaisen">Jujutsu Kaisen</a> but haven't managed it yet. I finished season 2 of <a class="italic" href="https://www.thetvdb.com/series/fallout">Fallout</a> and would say that I was whelmed. My wife and I watched the first season of <a class="italic" href="https://thetvdb.com/series/the-white-lotus">The White Lotus</a>, which I enjoyed, but she wasn't too impressed with it.
